## 🚀 Overview

**Omi Local** is a fully functioning, self-hosted alternative to the official Omi app. It is designed for users who want full control over their data, zero monthly subscriptions, and a powerful local-first AI experience.

It connects directly to your Omi hardware (Friend/DevKit) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and processes audio entirely on your terms—whether that's using local Whisper models on your iPhone or your own private API keys for Cloud transcription.

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Privacy & Sovereignty

- **100% Local Storage**: All memories, tasks, and conversations live in a SQLite database on your device.
- **Your Keys, Your Model**: Bring your own OpenAI/Deepgram keys. No middleman servers.
- **Offline Capable**: Use local Whisper models to transcribe audio without an internet connection.
- **Export All Data**: Export your entire database as JSON anytime.
- **iCloud Backup**: Optional sync across your devices.

### 🧠 Advanced AI

- **Memories**: Automatically extracts important facts. Edit or add memories manually by selecting text.
- **Actionable Tasks**: Detects promises and to-dos with scheduled local notifications.
- **Hold-to-Ask**: Hold the Omi button to chat with your AI assistant in real-time.

### ⚡️ Modern Hardware Integration

- **Direct BLE Connection**: Low-latency audio streaming from Omi devices.
- **Battery Notifications**: Alerts at 50% and 20% battery levels.
- **Device Management**: View battery life, adjust mic gain, and LED dimming.

### 🎨 Premium Experience

- **Dark Mode UI**: Polished design with smooth animations.
- **Conversation Search**: Find past conversations instantly.
- **Duration Display**: See how long each conversation lasted.
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Track your usage with conversation counts, word totals, and more.
- **Notification Controls**: Toggle every notification type individually.
